## Business Analytics 

### Project 1 - [Airbnb Optimal Hosting Location](https://github.com/yyklee/Location-Suggestion-Airbnb-Hosts)
This project analyzes Airbnb data to provide insights into the short-term rental market. I focused on finding the best neighborhoods in Seattle for new hosts, identifying popular room types, and assessing the competition. Additionally, I conducted a word frequency analysis of reviews to understand guest preferences. The analysis involved data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling

### Project 2 - [Starbucks Coupon Tracker Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ella.lee8628/viz/starbucks-reward/Dashboard)
The purpose of this project is to track and analyze the effectiveness of coupon offers within the Starbucks Rewards program. By examining data on the number of BOGO and Discount coupons offered and their subsequent reception, viewing, and completion rates across different demographics, the project aims to understand customer engagement with these promotions.
