## Business Analytics

### Project 1 - [Airbnb Optimal Hosting Location](https://github.com/yyklee/Location-Suggestion-Airbnb-Hosts)
This project analyzes Airbnb data to provide insights into the short-term rental market. I focused on finding the best neighborhoods in Seattle for new hosts, identifying popular room types, and assessing the competition. Additionally, I conducted a word frequency analysis of reviews to understand guest preferences. The analysis involved data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling
